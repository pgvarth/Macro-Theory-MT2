# Numerical Assignments using Matlab

This folder contains numerical assignments solved for the course Macro Theory II along with some indicative MATLAB files. Please note that there might be bugs and errors. All errors are our own.

## Data Assignment

In this data assignment, you use macroeconomic data at different frequencies (i.e., annual and quarterly) to conduct standard macroeconomic data processing and compute business cycle statistics.
- The assignment is described in the PDF file entitled *Data assignment*.
- The MATLAB file entitled *Data_Assignment* provides some indicative code.

## Dynamic Backward-looking IS-LM Model

In this numerical assignment, you solve for a simple dynamic backward-looking *IS-LM* model. 

- The assignment is described in the PDF file entitled *MT2_Num_Ass_DynamicISLM*.
- The MATLAB file entitled *backward_dynamic_ISLM* solves for the steady-state equilibrium and the dynamic transition.
- The MATLAB file entitled *IS_LM_increaseG* examines a rise in government spending.
- The MATLAB file entitled *IS_LM_increaseT* examines a rise in taxes.
- The MATLAB file entitled *IS_LM_mon_policy* examines a rise in nominal interest rates.
