## Data assignment

In this data assignment you use macroeconomic data at different frequencies (annual and quarterly) to conduct some standard macroeconomic data processing and compute business cycles statistics.
- The assignment is described in the pdf file entitled as *Data assignment*.
- The m-file entitled *Data_Assignment* provides some indicative code.

## Dynamic backward-looking IS-LM model

In this numerical assignment you solve for a simple dynamic backward looking *IS-LM* model. 

- The assignment is described in the pdf file entitled as *MT2_Num_Ass_DynamicISLM*.
- The m-file entitled *backward_dynamic_ISLM* solves for the steady state equilibrium and the dynamic transition.
- The m-file entitled *IS_LM_increaseG* examines a rise in government spending.
- The m-file entitled *IS_LM_increaseT* examines a rise in taxes.
- The m-file entitled *IS_LM_mon_policy* examines a rise in nominal interest rate.
