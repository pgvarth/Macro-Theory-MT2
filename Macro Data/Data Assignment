\begin{exercise}{1}\vspace{0.1cm}
Use the file mat file $GDP \textunderscore data$ to load your dataset. In this file, there are three matrices with data: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nominal GDP 
    \item Real GDP 
    \item GDP Index 
\end{enumerate}
Each matrix contains the respective time series over the period 1995-2022 for Euro Area and Greece in the first and second column, respectively.\\

Create an M-file which executes the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Loads the mat file with your dataset.
    \item Creates a matrix \textit{gdp \textunderscore deflator} in which it stores the respective GDP deflator for EA and Greece.
    \item Take the logarithm (use log(X))
    \item Computes the growth rates of nominal, $\Delta log( Y_{t}) $, real GDP, $\Delta(log (y_{t}))$, and GDP deflator, $\Delta log(P_{t})$.
    \item Shows that $$ \frac{Y_{t}}{Y_{t-1}}  =\frac{y_{t}}{y_{t-1}} \frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}$$ or in logs $$\Delta log( Y_{t})  =\Delta(log (y_{t})) +  \Delta log(P_{t})$$    
\end{enumerate}
 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{2}\vspace{0.1cm}
Create a Matlab \textbf{function} that finds the base year, i.e., finds $t$ for which $Y_{t}=y_{t}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{3}\vspace{0.1cm}
Create a Matlab \textbf{function} that plots in three subplots Nominal and real GDP growth as well as the growth rate of GDP deflator.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{4}\vspace{0.1cm}
Now, use the excel file entitled as \textit{Annual \textunderscore Data} which contains the main macroeconomic aggregates on an annual frequency (nominal, real and deflators) for EA and Greece taken from Eurostat and repeat the steps of exercises 1 to 3 for the following variables:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Final consumption expenditure
    \item Final consumption expenditure of general government
    \item Final consumption expenditure of households
    \item Gross fixed capital formation
     \item Exports of goods and services
     \item Imports of goods and services
\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{5}\vspace{0.1cm}
Now, use the excel file entitled as \textit{Quarterly \textunderscore Data} which contains the main macroeconomic aggregates on quarterly frequency taken from Eurostat and repeat exercises 1-3 for the following variables:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Gross domestic product 
    \item Final consumption expenditure
    \item Gross fixed capital formation
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
